        <p>
            My system offers safekeeping of data in remote (and non
            -remote) disks, using RAID5 protocol. This system was 
            created as a final project for "Gvahim". 
            The system offers many services, such as
            reading and writing of blocks, even with one faulty disk,
            system management (stats and info a bot the disk system).
            The entire system works asynchronously, so that the system can 
            support many multiple requests at the same time. All of my 
            code can be found on Github:

        <h2>About RAID5</h2>
        <p>
            Raid5 (Redundant array of independent disks), is a
            configuration on a set of disks, that employs techniques
            of parity to create large reliable data stores from 
            multiple physical hard drives.
            Raid5 implements a technique of distributed parity,
